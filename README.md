## Hello, I'm Santosh Majji ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
I am currently a graduate student at **Northeastern University**, specializing in Product Management with a strong focus on Engineering Management. My professional journey spans both the private and public sectors, including key roles in multinational corporations and innovative startups, where Iâ€™ve gained expertise across diverse environments.

Recently, Iâ€™ve joined **MassDOT** as one of their first AI hires, where I lead the development of AI products to improve operational efficiency and service delivery. I am helping MassDOT harness AI to stay at the forefront of technology, which enhances everything from document navigation to project workflows for engineers.

Previously, I worked as a **Generative AI Product Development Consultant**, collaborating with public sector entities to accelerate the adoption of disruptive and innovative technologies. As part of the inaugural **AI4Impact program** under InnovateMA, I led the development of the **Resource Gateway** for MassDOT's Highway Division. This tool enables engineers to efficiently navigate complex Standard Operating Procedures, streamlining document retrieval and improving project management workflows.

Earlier, at **Deloitte Consulting**, I was a core part of the AI Garage team in the Strategy and Analytics department. This experience helped me build strong skills in data preprocessing and machine learning model development, working on both software and hardware solutions. I excelled at extracting actionable insights from large datasets and transforming them into strategic, business-oriented recommendations.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from CBIT, and I am driven by a relentless pursuit of professional growth. I continuously aim to refine my skills and stay ahead of emerging industry trends, particularly at the intersection of **product management**, **AI**, and **data-driven solutions**.

One of my core strengths is fostering cross-functional teamwork, where I leverage my interpersonal skills to enhance collaboration and team cohesion. I thrive in environments that demand innovation, strategic thinking, and a passion for delivering results through technology.
